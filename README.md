## General info
<b><i>Foodprint</i></b> aims to increase awareness of health risk factors by providing warnings and precautions if your eating habits are taking an unpleasant turn. Through the use of computer vision in a wide variety of android phones, we can promote <b><i>Healthier, Longer, and Better Lives.</i></b>

## Project Summary
In today's generation, taking photos of what people eat is a massive cultural and influential phenomenon on platforms like Instagram. In fact, according to social media research by Influencer Marketing Hub in 2021, hashtags related to food such as #food, #yummy, #foodporn, and #instafood are among the 100 most popular hashtags are used in the approximately 50 billion photos posted on Instagram as of 2021. It means food is one of the most photographed subjects on the said platform.

<br><br>
Instead of posting these food photos solely for display, why not use these to learn more about people's food? Through our proposed app entitled Foodprint, which mainly utilizes Image Recognition, we can be aware of the estimated calories of the food we consume daily, weekly, or monthly.
<br><br>
According to the latest update of the World Health Organization, nutritional diseases such as obesity and malnutrition have significantly affected people's life span, reducing it to almost ten years. Moreover, many mobile applications tended to help the said problem, like food tracker apps that people can use to improve and keep track of their eating habits. Still, it is noticeable that most of these apps are too tedious and complicated to use, requiring every user to enter an absurd amount of information before they can even use them. Also, it is very time-consuming and takes a lot of discipline to input every type of food manually. Lastly, some applications are not suitable for general audiences due to focusing only on gym exercises. Thus, Foodprint is a mobile application that can easily monitor eating habits with just a photo snap. With the help of Image Recognition and Machine Learning, it can tell users the estimated nutritional information about the food they eat. Furthermore, Foodprint will utilize the image recognition model, including the idea of a custom dataset containing various types of food on pre-trained weights.
